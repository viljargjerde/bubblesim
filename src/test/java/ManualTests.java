 * Some parts of the testing is best done manually. The first part is to test
 * that the UI works as expected, that is; it is possible to start, pause and
 * continue an electrode, that it is possible to zoom and that changing
 * parameters works. Testing parameterchanging can be done by changing a
 * parameter, and then switch to another and back again and verifying that the
 * value is the one entered. An additional test that should be done is reducing
 * pressure and checking if bubbles increase in size.
